# Motion

Welcome to **Motion,** a library used to create beautiful animations and transitions for views, layers, and view controllers.

## Photos Sample

Take a look at a sample [Photos](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/tree/master/Projects/Programmatic/Photos) project to get started.

### Who is MotionÂ for?

Motion is designed for beginner to expert developers. For beginners, you will be exposed to very powerful APIs that would take time and experience to develop on your own, and experts will appreciate the time saved by using Motion.

### What you will learn

You will learn how to use Motion with a general introduction to fundamental concepts and easy to use code snippets.

# Transitions

Motion transitions a source view to a destination view using a linking identifier property named `motionIdentifier`.

| Match | Translate | Rotate | Arc | Scale |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Match](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions_identifier/match.gif) |  ![Translate](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions_identifier/translate.gif) | ![Rotate](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions_identifier/rotate.gif) | ![Arc](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions_identifier/arc.gif) | ![Scale](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions_identifier/scale.gif) |

### Example Usage

An example of transitioning from one view controller to another with transitions:

#### View Controller 1

```swift
greyView.motionIdentifier = "foo"
orangeView.motionIdentifier = "bar"
```

#### View Controller 2

```swift
isMotionEnabled = true
greyView.motionIdentifier = "foo"
orangeView.motionIdentifier = "bar"
orangeView.transition(.translate(x: -100))
```

The above code snippet tells the source views in `view controller 1` to link to the destination views in `view controller 2` using the `motionIdentifier`. Animations may be added to views during a transition using the **transition** method. The *transition* method accepts MotionTransition structs that configure the view's animation.

## UINavigationController, UITabBarController, and UIViewController Transitions

Motion offers default transitions that may be used by UINavigationControllers, UITabBarControllers, and presenting UIViewControllers.

| Push | Slide | ZoomSlide | Cover | Page | Fade | Zoom |

| ![Push](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/push.gif)  | ![Slide](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/slide.gif)| ![Zoom Slide](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/zoom_slide.gif) | ![Cover](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/cover.gif) | ![Page](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/page_in.gif) | ![Fade](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/fade.gif) | ![Zoom](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/transitions/zoom.gif)|

### Example Usage

An example of transitioning from one view controller to another using a UINavigationController with a zoom transition:

#### UINavigationController

```swift
class AppNavigationController: UINavigationController {
    open override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        isMotionEnabled = true
        motionNavigationTransitionType = .zoom
    }
}
```

To add an automatic reverse transition, use `autoReverse`.

```swift
motionNavigationTransitionType = .autoReverse(presenting: .zoom)
```

# Animations

Motion provides the building blocks necessary to create stunning animations without much effort. Motion's animation API will make maintenance a breeze and changes even easier. To create an animation, use the **animate** method of a view or layer and pass in a list of MotionAnimation structs. MotionAnimation structs are configurable values that describe how to animate a property or group of properties.

| Border Color & Border Width | Depth | Position | Scale | Spin | Translate |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![Border Color & Border Width](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/border_color.gif) | ![Depth](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/depth.gif) | ![Position](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/position.gif) | ![Scale](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/scale.gif) | ![Spin](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/spin.gif) | ![Translate](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/animations/translate.gif) |

### Example Usage

```swift
let box = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
box.backgroundColor = .blue

box.animate(.background(color: .red), .rotate(180), .delay(1))
```

In the above code example, a box view is created with a width of 100, height of 100, and an initial background color of blue. Following the general creation of the view, the _Motion animate_ method is passed _MotionAnimation structs_ that tell the view to animate to a red background color and rotate 180 degrees after a delay of 1 second. That's pretty much the general idea of creating animations.
